# VR
DESCRIPTION:
A workspace for building Oculus Rift applications. Includes examples of different movement and UI systems. Anyone may feel free to use this as a spring-board for starting a new game or application. 

Many of the included scripts are written in a generic way so that they work for as many Unity VR applications as possible. To view the files I recommend downloading the entire project and opening it in a version of Unity greater than 5.1.

ITEMS OF NOTE: <br>
1. Complex system for a dynamic world space menu generated based on components attached to character. [Removed] <br>
2. UI occlusion of world objects using second camera.<br>
3. Included <b>Oculus Rift</b> examples developed by Oculus VR. <br>
4. Xbox controller movement (based on modular Unity Input Class). Left-Thumbstick for movement and Bumpers for camera rotation. <br><br> 

OTHER ITEMS OF NOTE:
